Nasa Space App Challenge 2019

Team ATLANTA

project name: Stay Safe

Project Description:

Every year natural disasters kill around 90 000 people and affect close to 160 million people worldwide. Natural disasters include earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, landslides, hurricanes, floods, wildfires, heat waves and droughts. They have an immediate impact on human lives and often result in the destruction of the physical, biological and social environment of the affected people, thereby having a longer-term impact on their health, well-being and survival.
To reduce mortality rate during natural disaster, we develop the app named "Stay Safe".Which will use nasa data by using nasa EONET api to locate the location which is under attack of the natural disaster or can be affected by the natural disaster in near future. This app will notify the users of that area about the 
upcoming disaster and suggest necessary steps to be safe.
This information will be sent to the humatrian organisation who helps people during natural disaster such as UNICEF, RED CROSS,International Relief Teams, International Rescue Committee.
